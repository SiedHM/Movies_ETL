# Challenge-8
by: Sied H. Mohamed

# Purpose of the project:
The purpose of this project is to extract movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle and movie rating data from movie land website. Once the data is extracted, I transform and clean the data, combine the cleaned data from these different sources and load to SQL table. I used Extract, Transform and Load python pipelines.  Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy and other libraries have been used in the ETL process.  

# Data sources 
I used Wikipedia Movies released since 1990 and The Kaggle dataset pulls from the MovieLens dataset of over 20 million reviews and contains a metadata file with details about the movies from The Movie Database.
